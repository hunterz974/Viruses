Welcome, and come see my viruses that aren't that dangerous but funny!
I'll introduce each one of them:
WELIVEWELOVEWELIE.bat is a file that when started copies itself into your startup apps file and will spam a 10h long video of Smurf Cat (original link here https://youtu.be/QxYpiBlHr1w?si=ldxvQ46jo002Gjhb)
noexplorer.bat is a file that will constantly terminate windows explorer which will make you have a blank dark screen with only your cursor (does copy itself)!
noram.bat is a file that will start every instance the top five of the most memory using apps on every windows computer so that you ram won't be anymore (does copy itself)!
nowindows.bat is the only dangerous one here! It will force format drive c:\ and so on delete everything on that drive (does copy itself)!!!
